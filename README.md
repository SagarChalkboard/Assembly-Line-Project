# Assembly Line Simulation Project

## Overview

This project involves creating a C++ assembly line simulation using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles. The simulation models an assembly line with multiple stations that work together to process customer orders for various products. The project is structured into three milestones, progressively building the simulation's functionality.

## Milestone 1

Milestone 1 focuses on implementing and testing the `Utilities` and `Station` classes. The `Utilities` class assists in parsing input files and tokenizing strings. On the other hand, the `Station` class manages station-related information, such as items and customer order processing.

## Milestone 2

Milestone 2 introduces the `CustomerOrder` module, handling customer orders and their items. The `CustomerOrder` class oversees the movement of orders along the assembly line, ensuring they are filled by various stations. Additionally, the `Workstation` class, representing active stations, is implemented to fill customer orders and progress them to the next station.

## Milestone 3

The final milestone focuses on the `LineManager` module. The `LineManager` class configures the assembly line, manages order movement through stations, and handles the completion or incompleteness of orders. The simulation showcases the step-by-step processing of orders and station interactions.

## Key Concepts

- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
